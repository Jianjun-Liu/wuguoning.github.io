**'This is about the history of Calculus'**

> "The main duty of the historian of mathematics, as well as his fondest privilege, is to explain the humanity of mathematics, to illustrate its greatness, beauty, and dignity, and to describe how he incessant efforts and accumulated of many generations have built up that magnificent monument, the object of our most legitimate pride as men, and of our wonder, humility and thankfulness, and individuals. The study of the history of mathematics will not make better mathematicians but gentler one, it will enrich their minds, mellow their hearts, and bring out their finer qualities."

The discovery of calculus is often attributed to two men, **Issac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz**, who independently developed it foundations. Although they both instrumental in it creation, they thought of the fundamental concepts in very different ways. While Newton considered variable changing with time, Leibniz thought of the variable $x$ and $y$ as ranging over sequences of infinitely close value. He introduced $dx$ and $dy$ as differences between successive values of these sequences. Leibniz knew that $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ gives the tangent but did not use it as a defining property. One the other hand, Newton used quantities $x'$ and $y'$, which were finite velocities, to compute the tangent. Of course neither Leibniz nor Newton thought in terms of functions, but both always thought in terms of graphs. For Newton the calculus was geometrical while Leibniz took it towards analysis.
